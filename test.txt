wow

look we're branching

we branched some more. We did work. Now we'll merge this in.

Now we try making some more changes

and then we'll make a new branch holding these changes.

seems like no commit happened for the merge.

Seems we need to do it with the --no-ff flag to get the merge commit to revert.

So lets try again
